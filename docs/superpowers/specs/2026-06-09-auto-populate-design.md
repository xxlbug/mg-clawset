# Auto-Populate Room Designer — Design Spec

Date: 2026-06-09
Status: Approved

## Goal

Add an "Auto-fill" feature to the room designer that automatically populates
the active room with owned furniture, optimizing for one of three presets:

- **Breeding** — highest comfort + highest stimulation
- **Storage** — moderate comfort + health + low stimulation
- **Mutation** — moderate comfort + highest mutation

## Decisions (user-approved)

| Question | Decision |
|---|---|
| Furniture pool | Owned items only, minus copies already placed in other rooms ("remaining") |
| Non-empty room | Confirm dialog, then wipe and fill fresh |
| Preset semantics | Weighted stat score per item |
| Algorithm | Greedy first-fit (deterministic, instant) |

## Preset Weights

```
score(item) = Σ weight[stat] × item[stat]

breeding: { comfort: 1.0, stimulation: 1.0 }
storage:  { comfort: 0.5, health: 1.0, stimulation: -1.0 }
mutation: { comfort: 0.5, mutation: 1.0 }
```

Items with score ≤ 0 are never placed.

## Architecture

### 1. `src/utils/gridHelpers.ts` (extraction, no behavior change)

Move from `RoomGrid.tsx` (currently module-private):

- `buildOccupancy(placed, cfg, ignoreId?, ignoreIds?)`
- `buildAnchorPointSet(placed, cfg, ignoreId?, ignoreIds?)` — includes floor
  anchors (`row === cfg.rows`) and ceiling anchors (`row === -1` when
  `cfg.hasTopAnchors`)
- `canPlace(item, row, col, occupancy, anchorPointSet, cfg)`

`RoomGrid.tsx` imports these. Auto-populate uses the same functions, so
automatic placement obeys exactly the same rules as manual drag placement.

### 2. `src/utils/autoPopulate.ts` (new, pure logic)

```ts
export type PresetKey = 'breeding' | 'storage' | 'mutation';
export const PRESETS: Record<PresetKey, { label: string; weights: Partial<Record<StatKey, number>> }>;

export function autoPopulateRoom(opts: {
  preset: PresetKey;
  roomIndex: number;                       // getRoomConfig handles attic
  allFurniture: FurnitureItem[];
  ownership: Record<string, number>;
  usedInOtherRooms: Record<string, number>; // item.id -> count
  makeInstanceId: () => string;
}): PlacedFurniture[];
```

Algorithm:

1. Candidates: items where `(ownership[id] ?? 0) − (usedInOtherRooms[id] ?? 0) > 0`
   and weighted score > 0. Sort by score-per-occupied-space desc; ties by
   total score desc, then name asc (deterministic).
2. Loop over candidates best-first. For the current best item, scan the grid
   top-left → bottom-right (offsets that allow anchors above row 0 included:
   start row at `-shapeHeight`); place at first position where `canPlace`
   passes. On placement: decrement remaining, update occupancy and anchor-point
   set incrementally, then restart from the best candidate (new anchor points
   may unlock anchored items).
3. If an item has no valid position, drop it from the candidate list.
4. Stop when candidate list is empty.

Complexity: O(items × cells × shape) per placement round — instant for
16×7 / 31×8 grids and ~hundreds of items.

### 3. UI — `RoomDesignerWorkspace.tsx`

- Header row gains: preset `<select>` (Breeding / Storage / Mutation) +
  "Auto-fill" button, placed next to the Expert View toggle.
- Acts on the active room (existing room selector = room choice).
- If active room non-empty: `window.confirm("Replace N items in <room>?")`.
- If result is empty (no owned furniture fits / none remaining):
  `window.alert` explaining nothing could be placed; room left untouched.

### 4. `App.tsx`

New callback `handleAutoPopulate(preset: PresetKey)`:

- Computes `usedInOtherRooms` (usedCounts minus active room's contribution).
- Calls `autoPopulateRoom`, replaces `rooms[activeRoom]` with result.
- Passes down to `RoomDesignerWorkspace`.

## Error Handling

- No candidates / nothing fits → alert, no state change.
- Confirm declined → no state change.
- All placement validity delegated to shared `canPlace` — no new invariants.

## Testing

Repo has no test infra. Add `vitest` (dev dep only, no config beyond
`vite.config.ts` test block or standalone) and unit-test `autoPopulateRoom`:

- never exceeds remaining counts
- no overlapping solid cells; all placements pass `canPlace`
- respects attic cell validity (roomIndex 4)
- anchored items only placed when anchor support exists
- preset weight ordering: breeding room outranks storage preset on
  comfort+stim total, storage avoids positive-stimulation items, etc.
- empty pool → empty result

UI layer untested (matches repo status quo).

## Out of Scope

- Optimal packing (NP-hard), multi-start randomization, local search
- Fill-around-existing-furniture mode
- Custom user weights / sliders
- Mobile UI (room designer hidden on mobile already)

## Addendum (2026-06-09): Algorithm choice

User feedback: greedy first-fit leaves too many holes. Added user-selectable
algorithm next to the preset dropdown:

- **Quick** (`greedy`) — original deterministic greedy first-fit.
- **Maximize** (`maximize`, default) — multi-start randomized greedy (jittered
  ordering, random scan directions) plus ruin-and-recreate local search
  (remove ~30% incl. anchor cascades, refill), under a ~400ms time budget.
  Keeps the highest-scoring layout (ties: more cells filled). Never worse than
  greedy (greedy run is the baseline candidate). Seeded RNG + fixed iteration
  count give reproducible results in tests; UI uses time-based budget, so each
  click can re-roll a different layout.

Measured in app: same pool filled 92/112 cells (Quick) vs 108/112 (Maximize).

## Addendum (2026-06-10): Stat selection + grouped UX

User feedback: presets too generic; controls felt disconnected.

- Presets replaced by free stat selection: checkboxes for Appeal, Comfort,
  Stimulation, Health, Mutation (equal weight, sum of selected stats;
  score ≤ 0 still never placed). API: `stats: StatKey[]` replaces `preset`.
- UI consolidated into one "Auto-fill ▾" button opening a popover panel:
  stat checkboxes (with stat icons), Quick/Maximize radio, "Fill <room>"
  button (disabled when no stat selected). Outside click closes panel.

## Addendum (2026-06-10): Onboarding & game-companion UX

- Welcome modal shows once (dismissal persisted in `mg-clawset-welcome-seen`);
  cat logo reopens it. Modal gains a primary "Load savegame" CTA that opens
  the savefile import dialog.
- Room designer is open by default on desktop; savegame import auto-enables
  the "Owned" filter so the list shows what the player actually has.
- Attic is the default active room.
- Auto-fill is the visually primary (accent) button in the designer header.
- New "Checklist" panel: aggregated items of the active room (icon, count,
  name) with persisted tick-off state (`mg-clawset-checklist`) and an
  "n of m placed in game" progress line — for transferring layouts into
  Mewgenics.
- New "Focus" mode: hides the furniture browser entirely (full-width
  designer) for playing alongside the game; "Exit focus" restores it.

## Addendum (2026-06-10, #2): Room-first layout redesign

User feedback: UI was browser-first with the USP (room filler) hidden in a
side panel; welcome modal was a text wall with buried actions.

- First run: minimal **hero screen** — logo, one-line pitch, primary
  "Load savegame", secondary "Browse without a save". Shown once
  (`mg-clawset-hero-seen`). All how-to text lives behind the cat icon.
- New persistent **header bar**: cat mascot (help), title, always-visible
  "Load / Re-load savegame" button.
- **Room designer is the main view** on desktop, always visible.
- **Furniture browser demoted to a collapsible left drawer** (~460px,
  compact cards). Defaults: open with full catalog when no ownership
  (theorycrafters); closed with "Owned" filter active when a collection
  exists. Toggled via "◂ Furniture" in the designer or the edge arrow.
- "Focus" mode removed — closing the drawer is the same thing.
- Mobile keeps the original browser-only experience (designer needs
  drag-and-drop); the one-time welcome modal still auto-opens there.

## Addendum (2026-06-10, #3): Remembered savefile (one-click re-sync)

- Savefile parsing extracted to `src/utils/savegame.ts` (shared by modal and
  silent reload).
- `src/utils/savefileHandle.ts`: stores the FileSystemFileHandle from
  `showOpenFilePicker` in IndexedDB (`mg-clawset/file-handles`). Chromium
  only; Firefox/Safari keep the classic file input.
- Modal file selection uses the FSA picker when available and reports the
  handle up; App persists it and shows the filename in the header tooltip.
- Header "Re-load savegame": queries/requests read permission on the stored
  handle, re-reads the file from disk, re-imports ownership — one click.
  Any failure (no handle, permission denied, file moved) falls back to the
  import dialog.

## Addendum (2026-06-10, #4): Savefile picker fix, right drawer, house view

- **Picker fix**: Chrome's File System Access picker blocklists %APPDATA%,
  where Mewgenics saves live ("can't open this file… system files"). Modal
  reverted to the classic file input, plus a drag-and-drop zone — dropped
  files yield handles via `DataTransferItem.getAsFileSystemHandle()` even
  from blocklisted paths, so dragging the .sav once still enables one-click
  re-load.
- **Drawer moved to the right**: designer left, furniture drawer right;
  opens via "Furniture ▸" button or a slim slide tab on the right edge;
  closes via the drawer's left-edge arrow or "Hide furniture".
- **Room unlock detection**: `files.house_unlocks` in the savegame is parsed
  (current house + unlock entries; every non-attic entry = one regular
  room). Locked rooms show greyed with a lock in the summary and house
  view, and are skipped by auto-fill. Persisted in
  `mg-clawset-house-unlocks`.
- **House view**: the "House" summary row is selectable and shows all rooms
  in the game's arrangement (attic top, Room 4/3, Room 1/2 — same as the
  image export). Clicking a mini room opens it. Auto-fill in house view
  fills the whole house attic-first with cross-room remaining accounting;
  "Save image of a house" is the capture action.
- Discovered for later: `files.house_state` contains the in-game furniture
  placements (room name + coordinates) — could power "import current
  layout from save".
